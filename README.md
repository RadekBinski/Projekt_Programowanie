# Projekt_Programowanie

This is a project which was needed to pass the programming classes on my university.

We were asked to write a small app in Java, which would generate the arrays of random numbers 
and then to calculate the basic statistic like average, median, mode and standard deviation
with the additional feature of saving the outcome of calculation as a .txt file.
